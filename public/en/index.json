[{"content":"In a high level what Azure virtual machine is composed of, the one\u0026rsquo;s components are:\nResource Group: a virtual machine is deployed into a Resource Group, that latter contains an Azure region. Deploying a virtual machine for that Resource Group means to choose in deliver a phisically virtual machine in that location in order to take closer users and/or applications will use the services hosted in it.\nSize: when building a virtual machine, it is necessary pick one size from a pre-configured list based on a number of CPU cores, amount of RAM and also disk performance capabilities. The choice depends on the workload scenario you have to that virtual machine. You are able to upgrade or downgrade the size has been deployed in it.\nNetwork: it represents the network activity your virtual machine will have with the rest of your environment, in which can extends to the internet activities if it should be necessary. Azure attach an internal IP address for internal communication in your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) but you are able also to allocate a public IP address for internet communication.\nImage Azure provides a list of preconfigured images based on a specific location. Those images involve either Windows or Linux operating systems.\nStorage Each virtual machine created has a block device called Azure Virtual Disk, or VHD. Each virtual machine has, at least, one virtual disk to host an operating system. Additional virtual disks can be added in order to support application data. The characteristics of those VHDs depends on the workload scenarios to deal with those data.\n","permalink":"https://caedunogueira.github.io/en/posts/how-create-azure-virtual-machines/","summary":"In a high level what Azure virtual machine is composed of, the one\u0026rsquo;s components are:\nResource Group: a virtual machine is deployed into a Resource Group, that latter contains an Azure region.
